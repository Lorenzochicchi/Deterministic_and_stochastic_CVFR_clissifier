# Deterministic and Stochastic CVFR Classifier

This repository hosts the code for the article **"Deterministic versus Stochastic Dynamical Classifiers: Opposing Random Adversarial Attacks with Noise"** by Chicchi et al.

- **`functions.py`**: Contains all the necessary functions, including the trainable model CVFR, which is implemented as a subclass of a Keras model.

- **`training.py`**: This script can be run to test the model on the MNIST dataset.

- **`notebook_CVFR.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook that includes both `functions.py` and `training.py`.
